<h2>What are the modifications you made to the game?</h2>
Minor Mod is John Lemon freezing and player unfreezing him with space bar taps.
<br>
Major Mod is a speed boot for John Lemon. A check mark on screen signals whether it is ready, active, or recharging.
<br>
<h2> What's the biggest challenge you have so far?</h2>
The biggest challenge I have had so far is code. Though I've learned more about CSharp and feel better about learning it.
<br>
<h2>Will you continue working on this assignment?</h2> 
Most likely not, but if i did, i would maybe change the UI placement of the recharge icon, and make the font size bigger for the freeze mod.
