# README - Song

## Who are your team members?
Jadyn Milo and Josiah Song

## What are the modifications you made to the game?
Minor Mod is John Lemon freezing and player unfreezing him with space bar taps.
Major Mod is a speed boost for John Lemon. A check mark on screen signals whether it is ready, active, or recharging.

## What's the biggest challenge you have so far?
The biggest challenge I have had so far is code, but this class has helped me feel more confident about the topic. I don't have everything memorized yet, but I'm having a good time learning.

## Will you continue working on this assignment?
I probably won't continue working on this assignment, but it has given me ideas on making a personal project that would help me grow in my game design skills.
